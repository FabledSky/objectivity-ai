# Historical Timeline
Formation of the Region – October 6th, 2023

## Pre-Human Geological History

### Formation of the Region: 4.6 Billion Years Ago to the Precambrian Era

The region now encompassing Israel and Palestine began forming with the Earth's crust approximately 4.6 billion years ago. During the Precambrian era, vast tectonic activity shaped the area's ancient basement rocks, which remain buried beneath younger sedimentary layers. These rocks are part of the Arabian-Nubian Shield, a large tectonic formation spanning parts of Africa and the Middle East. Evidence suggests this period laid the foundation for the region's diverse topography.

### Shaping of the Levant: Paleozoic to Mesozoic Eras (541--66 Million Years Ago)

During the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, the region was covered by shallow seas, leading to the accumulation of limestone, sandstone, and other sedimentary rocks. These layers are rich in fossils, offering insight into the area's ancient marine life. By the Jurassic period (201--145 million years ago), tectonic activity began uplifting parts of the region, forming early landmasses.

### The Tethys Sea and Continental Drift: Cenozoic Era (66 Million Years Ago to Present)

The breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and the closure of the Tethys Sea during the Cenozoic era significantly influenced the region's geological structure. This period saw the Arabian plate separating from Africa and colliding with the Eurasian plate, giving rise to the Zagros Mountains and the rift valley systems. The Jordan Rift Valley, part of the Great Rift System, is a key feature resulting from this tectonic activity. 

### Formation of the Dead Sea Basin

The Dead Sea Basin, one of the most prominent geological features of the region, formed approximately 3--5 million years ago due to tectonic shifts along the Jordan Rift Valley. The basin is the lowest point on Earth's surface and contains hypersaline waters, making it a unique ecological and geological landmark. 

### Climatic Evolution

Throughout its geological history, the region has experienced significant climatic changes, transitioning from tropical conditions during the Mesozoic to arid desert landscapes in the Cenozoic. These changes have shaped the area's biodiversity and the availability of resources, influencing its habitability for early humans and later civilizations.

## Prehistoric and Protohistoric Era
#### Paleolithic Period: Early Human Presence (300,000 BCE -- 10,000 BCE)

##### Early Human Settlements (Circa 300,000 BCE)

Evidence from archaeological sites such as Qafzeh and Skhul caves near Mount Carmel suggests that anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) lived in the region as early as 300,000 years ago. These humans coexisted with Neanderthals, whose presence is also documented in nearby caves such as Tabun. The region acted as a critical migration corridor for early humans moving out of Africa into Eurasia. Excavations have revealed flint tools, butchered animal bones, and evidence of fire usage, indicating a subsistence strategy based on hunting and gathering. 

##### Mousterian Culture (Circa 200,000 BCE -- 50,000 BCE)

The Neanderthals in the region developed a distinctive stone tool culture known as the Mousterian tradition. Tools from this era, primarily made of flint, were used for hunting, cutting, and processing animal hides. Archaeological evidence points to the sophisticated use of local resources for survival in varying climatic conditions. (*[Cambridge World Prehistory](https://www.cambridge.org/)*)

##### Emergence of Modern Humans (Circa 100,000 BCE)

The transition from Neanderthals to anatomically modern humans in the region is evidenced by fossil discoveries and genetic studies. Homo sapiens gradually replaced Neanderthals, utilizing improved tools and exhibiting more advanced social behaviors. 

##### Natufian Culture (Circa 12,000 BCE -- 10,000 BCE)

The Natufian culture, identified at sites like Ain Mallaha and Jericho, marked a transition from a purely nomadic lifestyle to semi-permanent settlements. Natufians constructed round stone huts and began the early cultivation of wild cereals, a precursor to agriculture. They also domesticated dogs and buried their dead in communal graves, showcasing increasingly complex societal structures. 

#### Neolithic Revolution: The Dawn of Agriculture (10,000 BCE -- 4500 BCE)

##### Beginnings of Agriculture (Circa 10,000 BCE)

The Neolithic Revolution began in the Levant, with the Israel-Palestine region playing a pivotal role in the domestication of plants such as wheat and barley and animals like sheep and goats. Archaeological sites such as Tell es-Sultan (ancient Jericho) provide evidence of organized farming, irrigation systems, and granaries, marking the transition to a sedentary lifestyle. 

##### Invention of Pottery (Circa 7000 BCE)

The invention of pottery revolutionized food storage and transportation. Pottery fragments found at Jericho and other Neolithic sites show increasing specialization and artistic expression, reflecting a shift toward more complex social structures. 

##### Construction of Jericho's Walls (Circa 8000 BCE)

Jericho, one of the world's earliest known cities, was fortified with massive stone walls, towers, and ditches. These defensive structures indicate advanced engineering knowledge and the presence of organized labor. They also suggest the need for protection against raids, emphasizing the growing competition for resources. 

#### Chalcolithic Period: Early Use of Metal (4500 BCE -- 3000 BCE)

##### Transition to Metallurgy (Circa 4500 BCE)

The Chalcolithic period introduced copper tools and ornaments, marking a significant technological advancement. At sites like Teleilat el-Ghassul, archaeologists have uncovered evidence of metal smelting and trade networks linking the Levant with Egypt and Mesopotamia. 

##### Emergence of Complex Societies (Circa 4000 BCE)

The Chalcolithic period saw the development of larger settlements with social stratification. Artifacts such as decorated pottery and ivory carvings reveal increasing social and economic complexity. Trade networks expanded, allowing the exchange of goods such as obsidian, shells, and precious metals. 

##### Religious Practices and Art (Circa 3500 BCE)

Religious artifacts, including figurines and temple remains, point to the rise of organized belief systems. The Chalcolithic Temple at Ein Gedi provides evidence of ritual practices involving animal sacrifices and the use of sacred spaces. This period also saw the creation of symbolic art, indicating a sophisticated cultural framework. 

#### Transition to the Early Bronze Age (Circa 3000 BCE)

##### Urbanization and Social Stratification

By 3000 BCE, the region began transitioning to the Early Bronze Age. This period was marked by the emergence of city-states, written records, and intensified trade networks. Settlements such as Jericho and Megiddo evolved into urban centers with hierarchical governance and fortified defenses, setting the stage for the development of ancient civilizations.

## Ancient History
#### Early Canaanite Cities (Circa 3000 BCE)

During the Early Bronze Age, around 3000 BCE, the region witnessed the rise of Canaanite cities, marking its emergence as a key cultural and economic hub in the ancient Near East. Cities like Jericho, Hazor, Megiddo, and Lachish became prominent centers of trade and governance. These cities were fortified with walls and engaged in extensive trade with neighboring civilizations, including Egypt and Mesopotamia. Early urbanization was characterized by advanced water systems, agriculture, and the use of writing systems such as proto-Canaanite scripts. Archaeological findings, such as pottery and temple remains, attest to the region's significance as a cradle of civilization. 

#### Emergence of Semitic Cultures and Early Religious Practices (Circa 2500 BCE)

By the mid-Bronze Age, around 2500 BCE, the region saw the development of Semitic cultures influenced by Mesopotamian and Egyptian religious practices. Local deities such as Baal, El, and Asherah became central to Canaanite religious life. These practices laid the foundation for later monotheistic traditions. Archaeological evidence, such as cultic artifacts and temple ruins, reveals the complexity of religious and societal structures during this period. 

#### Biblical Accounts and Early Hebrew Tribes (Circa 2000 BCE)

Around 2000 BCE, during the Middle Bronze Age, the region became associated with biblical narratives. The story of Abraham's migration from Mesopotamia to Canaan, found in biblical texts, aligns with the migration patterns of Amorite tribes during this time. While these accounts are considered partially mythological, they reflect historical movements of Semitic peoples into the region. Abraham's story is foundational to the religious traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Archaeological evidence, such as burial sites and early settlement patterns, aligns with this narrative to some extent. 

#### Arrival of the Israelites and the Iron Age Transition (Circa 1200 BCE)

The transition to the Iron Age around 1200 BCE coincided with the decline of Canaanite city-states and the emergence of the Israelites. The Merneptah Stele, an Egyptian inscription dated to 1208 BCE, contains the earliest known reference to "Israel" as a people distinct within Canaan. This period saw the establishment of small, agrarian communities in the highlands, characterized by their lack of monumental architecture and reliance on terraced farming. These groups are believed to have coalesced into the early Israelites, gradually forming distinct cultural and religious practices centered around monotheism. 

#### Formation of Tribal Confederacies (Circa 1100 BCE)

By 1100 BCE, the Israelites formed loose tribal confederacies, as described in the biblical Book of Judges. This period was marked by decentralized governance, with charismatic leaders or "judges" serving as military and spiritual leaders. Archaeological evidence from this time reveals the transition from Canaanite urban centers to smaller, self-sufficient villages, highlighting the Israelites' distinct identity as a semi-nomadic people. 

#### Establishment of the Kingdom of Israel (Circa 1000 BCE)

The unification of the Israelite tribes under King Saul around 1000 BCE marked the establishment of the Kingdom of Israel. Saul's successor, King David, expanded the kingdom's territory and established Jerusalem as its political and religious capital. David's reign is credited with unifying the tribes and creating a centralized monarchy. His son, King Solomon, succeeded him and further enhanced the kingdom's prosperity through trade alliances and monumental projects, including the construction of the First Temple in Jerusalem. These developments solidified the region's identity as a unified political and cultural entity.

## Biblical and Classical Period
#### Reign of King Solomon and the First Temple (Circa 970--930 BCE)

During King Solomon's reign, the united Kingdom of Israel reached its zenith of political and cultural influence. Solomon is traditionally credited with constructing the First Temple in Jerusalem, which became the central place of worship for the Israelites. The Temple housed the Ark of the Covenant and symbolized the religious and political unification of the Israelite tribes. Archaeological evidence of monumental building projects from this period aligns with descriptions of Jerusalem's growth as a significant urban center. 

#### Division of the Kingdom (Circa 930 BCE)

After Solomon's death, disputes over succession led to the division of the kingdom into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah. This separation weakened both entities politically and militarily, making them more vulnerable to external powers such as Assyria and Babylon. Archaeological and textual evidence supports the existence of two distinct political entities during this period. 

#### Assyrian Conquest of the Northern Kingdom (722 BCE)

In 722 BCE, the northern Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrian Empire, led by King Sargon II. Many inhabitants were deported, an event that contributed to the dispersion of the so-called "Ten Lost Tribes." The region was resettled by people from other parts of the Assyrian Empire, creating a culturally mixed population. Assyrian records corroborate the biblical account of the conquest and subsequent deportations.

#### Babylonian Conquest of Judah and the First Temple's Destruction (586 BCE)

The Babylonian Empire, under King Nebuchadnezzar II, besieged and captured Jerusalem in 586 BCE. The city and its First Temple were destroyed, and a significant portion of the Jewish population was exiled to Babylon. This period, known as the Babylonian Exile, had profound cultural and religious impacts, including the consolidation of Jewish religious texts. Archaeological evidence from Jerusalem reveals layers of destruction consistent with this event. 

#### Exile Period and Cultural Adaptation (586--538 BCE)

During the Babylonian Exile, Jewish communities maintained their religious identity while adapting to life in a foreign land. This period saw the development of synagogue-based worship and the beginnings of a formalized religious canon. The exile also fostered theological shifts, such as a stronger emphasis on monotheism. 

#### Persian Conquest and the Return to Judah (538 BCE)

In 538 BCE, the Persian king Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon and issued the Cyrus Cylinder, a decree allowing exiled peoples, including Jews, to return to their homelands. This event marked the start of the Second Temple period, during which the Temple in Jerusalem was rebuilt. Persian administrative records support the return of exiled populations and the restoration of local governance. 

#### Introduction of Hellenistic Culture (332 BCE)

Alexander the Great's conquest of the region in 332 BCE integrated it into the Hellenistic world. Greek language, architecture, and governance significantly influenced local societies. While many local populations adopted Hellenistic practices, Jewish communities resisted full assimilation, preserving their religious identity. 

#### Revolt Against Hellenistic Rule: Maccabean Revolt (167--160 BCE)

The Maccabean Revolt arose in response to the Seleucid Empire's imposition of Hellenistic religious practices, including the desecration of the Second Temple. The revolt successfully established Jewish autonomy under the Hasmonean dynasty, which lasted for about a century. 

#### Incorporation into the Roman Republic (63 BCE)

In 63 BCE, Roman General Pompey captured Jerusalem and annexed the region into the Roman Republic. Roman rule introduced new administrative systems and infrastructure but also heightened tensions with local Jewish communities. Roman sources, such as writings by Josephus, provide detailed accounts of this period. 

#### Herod the Great and the Expansion of the Second Temple (37--4 BCE)

Herod the Great, a Roman client king, is known for his ambitious building projects, including the massive expansion of the Second Temple. This transformed Jerusalem into a major urban center and a focal point of Jewish religious life. Archaeological discoveries, including sections of the Temple Mount, affirm Herod's architectural contributions. 

#### Jewish Revolts and the Destruction of the Second Temple (66--70 CE)

The First Jewish Revolt against Roman rule culminated in the Roman siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. The destruction of the Second Temple marked a turning point in Jewish history, leading to the Jewish Diaspora and significant changes in religious practices. Roman records and archaeological findings confirm the scale of destruction during this period. 

#### Bar Kokhba Revolt and the Renaming of Jerusalem (132--136 CE)

The Bar Kokhba Revolt was the last major Jewish rebellion against Roman rule. Its suppression resulted in widespread devastation and the expulsion of Jews from Jerusalem, which the Romans renamed Aelia Capitolina. Roman historical texts and archaeological evidence document the revolt's impact. 

#### Christianization of the Region (313 CE)

With Emperor Constantine's Edict of Milan in 313 CE, Christianity was legalized and became a dominant force in the region. Jerusalem gained prominence as a Christian pilgrimage site, marked by the construction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other significant religious structures.

## Roman and Byzantine Periods
#### Roman Destruction of the Second Temple (70 CE)

In 70 CE, during the First Jewish Revolt (66--73 CE), Roman forces led by General Titus besieged Jerusalem, resulting in the destruction of the Second Temple. This marked a catastrophic turning point for Jewish religious and cultural life. The Temple, central to Jewish worship, was demolished, leaving only the Western Wall, which remains a sacred site today. The destruction led to widespread Jewish displacement and the beginnings of the Jewish Diaspora. Roman historian Josephus provides a detailed account of the siege, describing the widespread devastation, enslavement of survivors, and executions. Archaeological evidence, including remnants of the Second Temple and layers of destruction in Jerusalem, corroborates these accounts. 

#### Aftermath of the Jewish Revolt (70--130 CE)

Following the revolt, Roman authorities imposed harsh penalties on the Jewish population. The Fiscus Judaicus, a tax levied on Jews throughout the empire, funded the Temple of Jupiter in Rome. Many Jewish communities reorganized in diaspora locations such as Alexandria, Antioch, and Babylonia, fostering a growing emphasis on synagogue worship and religious study. This period laid the groundwork for post-Temple Judaism. 

#### Bar Kokhba Revolt and Renaming of Jerusalem (132--136 CE)

The Bar Kokhba Revolt (132--136 CE), led by Simon Bar Kokhba, was a Jewish rebellion against Roman rule, driven by resistance to Emperor Hadrian's policies, including the construction of a Roman temple on the Temple Mount. Initially successful, the revolt established an independent Jewish state for a brief period. However, Roman forces crushed the rebellion in 136 CE, killing hundreds of thousands of Jews and further depopulating the region. Jerusalem was renamed Aelia Capitolina, and a Roman colony was built on its ruins. Jews were banned from entering the city, intensifying the Jewish Diaspora. 

#### Romanization of the Region (2nd--3rd Centuries CE)

During the 2nd and 3rd centuries, Jerusalem and surrounding areas became fully integrated into the Roman Empire. Pagan temples and Roman administrative structures dominated the landscape. Roman engineering achievements, such as roads and aqueducts, transformed the region's infrastructure. The population consisted of a mix of pagans, Jews, and early Christians, with periodic tensions among these groups. 

#### Spread of Christianity and Constantine's Reign (313 CE)

In 313 CE, Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, legalizing Christianity and ending centuries of Christian persecution. Constantine's reign marked a pivotal moment as Christianity transitioned from a minority faith to the dominant religion of the empire. Jerusalem became a central site for Christian pilgrimage, revered as the location of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection. The city's religious significance was further elevated when Constantine's mother, Helena, identified key Christian sites, including Golgotha and the tomb of Christ. 

#### Construction of Christian Holy Sites (4th Century CE)

In 335 CE, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was completed, marking the site traditionally associated with Jesus's burial and resurrection. Other major constructions included the Basilica of the Nativity in Bethlehem and churches on the Mount of Olives. These projects solidified Jerusalem's role as a Christian religious center. Archaeological evidence, including fragments of these structures, supports their historical significance. 

#### Byzantine Rule and Religious Transformation (4th--6th Centuries CE)

Under Byzantine rule, which followed the division of the Roman Empire in 395 CE, Jerusalem became a key city in a predominantly Christian state. Pagan temples were dismantled or repurposed as churches. Jewish access to Jerusalem remained restricted, although Jewish communities persisted in Galilee and other areas. Christian monasticism flourished, particularly in the Judean Desert, where monasteries like Mar Saba were established. This period also saw tensions between different Christian sects, particularly over Christological doctrines. 

#### Persian Invasion and Fall of Jerusalem (614 CE)

In 614 CE, the Sasanian (Persian) Empire invaded Byzantine territories, capturing Jerusalem. The Persian army, supported by some local Jewish populations, desecrated Christian holy sites, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. For a brief period, Jewish leaders administered Jerusalem under Persian oversight. However, the Persian control was short-lived. 

#### Byzantine Reconquest (628 CE)

Emperor Heraclius recaptured Jerusalem in 628 CE, restoring Byzantine control. The Byzantines rebuilt Christian sites and reinstated strict policies against Jews, including expulsions and massacres. This period marked the final phase of Byzantine dominance over Jerusalem before the advent of Islam.

#### Prelude to Islamic Conquest (630s CE)

By the early 7th century, the Byzantine Empire was weakened by continuous wars with the Sasanian Empire and internal religious divisions. This instability set the stage for the Islamic conquest of Jerusalem and the surrounding region, which occurred in the 630s under the Rashidun Caliphate.

## Islamic Conquest and Early Islamic Period
#### Rise of Islam in Arabia (622 CE)

Islam emerged in the early 7th century in the Arabian Peninsula under the leadership of the Prophet Muhammad. The migration (Hijra) of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE marked the foundation of the first Muslim polity and the start of the Islamic calendar. Over the next decade, Muhammad unified much of Arabia through diplomacy, religious preaching, and military campaigns, establishing Islam as both a faith and a political framework. By the time of his death in 632 CE, the Arabian Peninsula was largely consolidated under Islamic rule. 

#### The Rashidun Caliphate and Early Conquests (632--661 CE)

Following Muhammad's death, the Rashidun Caliphate expanded Islam beyond Arabia. The second caliph, Umar ibn al-Khattab, led the Muslim armies to victory against the Byzantine Empire at the Battle of Yarmouk in 636 CE, a decisive conflict that secured Muslim control over the Levant, including Palestine. The region transitioned from Byzantine to Islamic governance, and non-Muslims, including Christians and Jews, were recognized as protected communities under the dhimmi system, which granted them religious freedom in exchange for a tax. This arrangement facilitated a relatively peaceful integration of the region into the Islamic world. 

#### Jerusalem's Integration into the Islamic World (638 CE)

In 638 CE, Caliph Umar entered Jerusalem following its peaceful surrender by the city's Christian leadership. According to historical accounts, Umar respected the city's Christian sanctuaries, choosing not to pray inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to avoid its appropriation as a mosque. Instead, he selected a site near the ruins of the Second Temple for Muslim prayer, which later became the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This marked the beginning of Jerusalem's status as the third holiest city in Islam, after Mecca and Medina. Umar's administration ensured religious coexistence and protection for the city's Christian and Jewish communities. 

#### Umayyad Dynasty and Jerusalem's Expansion (661--750 CE)

Under the Umayyad Caliphate, Jerusalem underwent significant development. In 691 CE, Caliph Abd al-Malik commissioned the construction of the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif). This architectural achievement symbolized the prominence of Islam and the Umayyads' religious and political authority. The Dome of the Rock also became a focal point of Islamic devotion, commemorating the Prophet Muhammad's night journey (Isra and Mi'raj). During this period, Jerusalem remained a hub for pilgrimage and Islamic scholarship, with the Al-Aqsa Mosque also receiving enhancements.

#### Abbasid Rule and Decline of Jerusalem's Prominence (750--969 CE)

The Abbasid Caliphate, which succeeded the Umayyads, shifted the political center of the Islamic world to Baghdad, reducing Jerusalem's administrative importance. However, the city retained its religious significance as a center for Muslim pilgrimage and scholarship. The Abbasid rulers contributed to the preservation of Jerusalem's Islamic heritage but focused their resources on other regions of their vast empire. This period saw a relative decline in large-scale development projects in the city. 

#### Fatimid Caliphate and Instability in Jerusalem (969--1099 CE)

The Fatimids, a Shia Muslim dynasty based in Cairo, gained control of Jerusalem in 969 CE. While the city remained an important religious site, it experienced periodic instability due to internal Fatimid struggles and external pressures. In 1009 CE, Caliph al-Hakim ordered the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a decision that caused outrage in Christian Europe and contributed to the tensions leading to the Crusades. Subsequent Fatimid rulers attempted to repair relations with Christian communities by rebuilding the church and restoring religious freedoms. 

#### Seljuk Turks and the Prelude to the Crusades (11th Century CE)

By the late 11th century, Jerusalem fell under the control of the Seljuk Turks, who imposed restrictions on Christian pilgrimages and reportedly mistreated pilgrims. These actions, combined with the strategic importance of the region, alarmed Christian Europe and led to the call for the First Crusade in 1095 CE. The Seljuk period marked a time of increased militarization and political fragmentation in the region, weakening its defenses against external invasions.

## Crusader and Ayyubid Periods
#### First Crusade and Capture of Jerusalem (1099 CE)

The First Crusade, called by Pope Urban II in 1095, aimed to reclaim Jerusalem and other Christian holy sites from Muslim control. The Crusade drew thousands of knights and soldiers from Europe, motivated by religious fervor, promises of spiritual salvation, and territorial ambitions. After a grueling campaign across Anatolia and the Levant, Crusader forces reached Jerusalem in June 1099. Following a month-long siege, the Crusaders breached the city's walls on July 15, 1099. They massacred much of the city's Muslim and Jewish population, an event described in both Christian and Muslim chronicles.

The Crusaders established the Kingdom of Jerusalem, a Latin Christian state, with Godfrey of Bouillon as its ruler. Religious sites, such as the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, were repurposed into Christian churches and administrative buildings, while the Church of the Holy Sepulchre became the focal point of Christian pilgrimage. This marked the beginning of nearly 200 years of Crusader presence in the region. 

#### Early Crusader Rule (1099--1187 CE)

The Kingdom of Jerusalem expanded its territory under successive rulers, establishing strongholds in cities like Acre, Jaffa, and Tyre. The Crusaders implemented a feudal system, with European nobles ruling over a predominantly Muslim population. Religious military orders, such as the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller, played a crucial role in protecting pilgrims and maintaining Crusader dominance.

Despite initial successes, the Crusaders faced constant pressure from surrounding Muslim states, which sought to reclaim lost territories. Muslim-Christian relations during this period varied, with periods of cooperation and coexistence punctuated by conflict and mistrust.

#### Muslim Counterattacks and the Rise of Saladin (1144--1187 CE)

In 1144 CE, Muslim forces recaptured the city of Edessa, a major Crusader stronghold, prompting the Second Crusade (1147--1150 CE). The Crusade ended in failure, further weakening Crusader control in the region.

By the late 12th century, Saladin (Salah ad-Din), the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, emerged as a unifying figure for Muslim forces. Saladin successfully consolidated control over Egypt and Syria, creating a formidable power base to challenge the Crusaders. His leadership emphasized both military strategy and diplomacy, rallying support from various Muslim factions. 

#### Battle of Hattin and Recapture of Jerusalem (1187 CE)

In 1187 CE, Saladin's forces decisively defeated the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin near the Sea of Galilee. The victory crippled the Crusader army, leading to the capture of key leaders, including King Guy of Jerusalem. Following this victory, Saladin's forces besieged Jerusalem, which surrendered peacefully in October 1187.

Unlike the Crusader conquest in 1099, Saladin spared the city's Christian population, allowing them to leave or remain peacefully in exchange for a ransom. Muslim control of Jerusalem was restored, and Islamic holy sites, including the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, were rededicated.

#### Third Crusade and the Treaty of Ramla (1189--1192 CE)

The Third Crusade, led by Richard the Lionheart of England, Philip II of France, and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I, was launched in response to the loss of Jerusalem. While the Crusaders achieved several victories, including the capture of Acre, they failed to retake Jerusalem.

The Treaty of Ramla in 1192 CE established a truce between Saladin and Richard, allowing Christians access to Jerusalem for pilgrimage while leaving the city under Muslim control. This treaty marked a temporary cessation of hostilities, although tensions remained. 

#### Ayyubid Consolidation and Crusader Decline (1192--1244 CE)

After the Third Crusade, the Ayyubid dynasty focused on consolidating control over Jerusalem and surrounding territories. Crusader states persisted, but internal divisions and diminishing European support weakened their position.

In 1229 CE, during the Sixth Crusade, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II negotiated the Treaty of Jaffa with Ayyubid Sultan al-Kamil, temporarily regaining control of Jerusalem through diplomacy. However, this arrangement was short-lived as Muslim forces retook the city in 1244 CE.

#### Fall of Acre and the End of the Crusader Presence (1291 CE)

The Crusader presence in the Levant ended with the fall of Acre in 1291 CE. Muslim forces, led by the Mamluks, decisively defeated the Crusaders, eliminating their last stronghold in the region. The fall of Acre marked the conclusion of nearly two centuries of Crusader attempts to establish Christian dominance in the Holy Land.

This event signaled the end of large-scale European involvement in the Levant for centuries, shifting the focus of European expansion to other regions.

#### Legacy of the Crusades in the Region

The Crusades profoundly affected the region's demographics, economy, and cultural landscape. Crusader fortifications, such as castles and churches, left a lasting architectural legacy, while the prolonged conflict deepened religious and cultural divides between Christian Europe and the Islamic world. The Crusades also spurred intellectual and economic exchanges, influencing both regions' development in subsequent centuries.

## Mamluk and Ottoman Periods
This section explores the Mamluk and Ottoman Periods in the Israel-Palestine region, spanning from 1260 CE to 1917 CE, detailing political, social, and cultural developments under two major Islamic empires.

#### Mamluk Sultanate and Rule of the Levant (1260--1517 CE)

##### Mamluks Defeat the Mongols at Ain Jalut (1260 CE)

The Mamluks, a military caste that rose to power in Egypt, decisively defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. This battle, fought near modern-day Galilee, marked the first significant defeat of the Mongols and secured Mamluk control over the Levant, including Palestine. This victory ended the Mongol threat to the region and ensured its inclusion in the Mamluk Sultanate, based in Cairo. 

##### End of the Crusader Presence (1291 CE)

In 1291, the Mamluks captured Acre, the last Crusader stronghold in the Levant, effectively ending two centuries of Crusader presence in the region. Following this victory, the Mamluks dismantled remaining Crusader fortifications to prevent any future incursions. 

##### Economic and Administrative Reforms

The Mamluks established a system of provincial governance, dividing the Levant into smaller administrative units governed by emirs. Jerusalem, Gaza, and Nablus became key centers of trade and administration. Mamluk policies encouraged trade along the Silk Road and other routes, linking Palestine to markets in Egypt, Syria, and beyond. 

##### Urban Development and Religious Investment

The Mamluks heavily invested in Jerusalem, restoring and enhancing Islamic holy sites, including the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque. They also constructed new religious schools (madrasas), inns (khans), and public baths (hammams) to support pilgrimage and economic activity. These projects reinforced Jerusalem's status as a major Islamic spiritual and cultural center. 

##### Decline of the Mamluks

By the late 15th century, the Mamluks faced economic decline due to the discovery of maritime trade routes that bypassed the Levant, reducing their revenue from overland trade. Additionally, internal corruption and external pressures, particularly from the rising Ottoman Empire, weakened their grip on the region. 

#### Ottoman Rule in the Levant (1517--1917 CE)

##### Ottoman Conquest of the Region (1517 CE)

In 1517, the Ottoman Empire, under Sultan Selim I, defeated the Mamluks at the Battle of Ridanieh, annexing the Levant, including Palestine, into the empire. The region became part of the province of Greater Syria (Bilad al-Sham), with Jerusalem designated as an important administrative and religious center. 

##### 16th Century: Integration and Early Development

The Ottomans implemented centralized governance and conducted land surveys to register property and standardize taxation. These reforms provided stability and integrated the region into the broader Ottoman economy. Major infrastructure projects, such as the restoration of aqueducts and roads, were undertaken to facilitate trade and pilgrimage. Jerusalem benefited from significant investment, including the restoration of the Haram al-Sharif complex. 

##### 17th--18th Centuries: Relative Stability and Local Autonomy

During this period, the region experienced relative stability but remained on the periphery of Ottoman priorities. Local elites, such as the al-Husayni family in Jerusalem, gained influence, often acting as intermediaries between the central Ottoman government and local populations. Agricultural production and trade, including olive oil and soap exports, sustained the regional economy. 

##### 19th Century: Tanzimat Reforms and Modernization

The Tanzimat reforms (1839--1876) aimed to modernize the Ottoman Empire and centralize its administration. In Palestine, these reforms introduced land registration laws, modern schools, and new infrastructure projects, including railways. The region saw increased European involvement, with Christian powers funding the restoration of holy sites and establishing missionary schools and hospitals. 

##### Egyptian Occupation Under Muhammad Ali (1831--1840 CE)

Between 1831 and 1840, the region was occupied by Egyptian forces under Muhammad Ali Pasha. The Egyptians sought to modernize agriculture and industry, though their policies met resistance from local populations. The Ottomans, with European support, eventually regained control. 

##### Late 19th Century: Rise of Nationalism and Zionist Settlement

Nationalist movements began emerging across the Ottoman Empire, including Arab nationalism in the Levant. Concurrently, waves of Jewish immigration, driven by the rise of Zionism and European antisemitism, brought new settlers to Palestine. Jewish immigrants purchased land and established agricultural communities, laying the foundation for future demographic and political shifts.

##### World War I and the End of Ottoman Rule (1914--1917 CE)

During World War I, the Ottoman Empire aligned with the Central Powers. The Levant became a key theater of conflict, with British forces capturing Jerusalem in December 1917. The war's end marked the collapse of Ottoman control, leading to the establishment of British rule under the League of Nations Mandate system.

## Interwar Period and the Road to 1948
#### World War I and the Balfour Declaration (1917)

##### Hussein-McMahon Correspondence (1915--1916)

The Hussein-McMahon Correspondence involved a series of letters between Sharif Hussein of Mecca and British High Commissioner Sir Henry McMahon. Britain promised Arab independence in exchange for support against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Although Palestine was not explicitly mentioned in the letters, subsequent British actions, such as the Balfour Declaration, created tensions with Arab leaders who believed Palestine would be included in their independence.

##### Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916)

The Sykes-Picot Agreement was a secret pact between Britain and France that divided the Ottoman territories in the Middle East into spheres of influence. Palestine was designated for international administration. The revelation of this agreement by the Bolsheviks in 1917 fueled Arab mistrust of British intentions.

##### Balfour Declaration (1917)

In November 1917, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour issued a declaration supporting "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," provided it did not prejudice the rights of non-Jewish communities. The declaration was vague and controversial, leading to conflicting interpretations by Jews and Arabs.

##### British Capture of Jerusalem (1917)

British forces, led by General Edmund Allenby, entered Jerusalem in December 1917, ending Ottoman rule over the city after four centuries. Allenby declared respect for all religious communities, marking the beginning of British administrative control over Palestine.

#### The British Mandate for Palestine (1920--1948)

##### San Remo Conference and Mandate Establishment (1920)

The San Remo Conference formalized Britain's control over Palestine. The League of Nations subsequently approved the British Mandate, which incorporated the Balfour Declaration. This gave Britain administrative authority and the responsibility to implement the declaration while safeguarding the rights of the local Arab population.

##### Early Tensions and Riots (1920--1921)

-   1920 Nebi Musa Riots: These riots, sparked by religious celebrations, escalated into violence between Arabs and Jews in Jerusalem, leaving five Jews and four Arabs dead.
-   1921 Jaffa Riots: Tensions over increasing Jewish immigration led to violent clashes in Jaffa, resulting in over 100 deaths. The riots underscored growing Arab resentment toward British policies and Zionist land acquisitions.

##### White Paper of 1922

In response to unrest, Britain issued the Churchill White Paper, clarifying that a Jewish national home would not encompass all of Palestine and reiterating the political rights of the Arab population. However, this did little to quell tensions.

#### Jewish Immigration and Land Purchases (1920s--1930s)

##### Zionist Immigration (Aliyahs)

-   First Aliyah (1882--1903) and Second Aliyah (1904--1914): Predating the mandate, these waves brought primarily Eastern European Jews fleeing persecution.
-   Third Aliyah (1919--1923): Following World War I and the Russian Revolution, Jewish immigration resumed, with settlers focusing on agriculture and building communal farms (kibbutzim).
-   Fourth Aliyah (1924--1928): Economic instability in Europe, particularly in Poland, spurred another wave of immigration.
-   Fifth Aliyah (1933--1939): The rise of Nazism in Germany brought tens of thousands of Jews to Palestine, further straining relations with the Arab population.

##### Land Purchases and Displacement

Zionist organizations facilitated land purchases, often from absentee landlords. Palestinian tenant farmers were frequently displaced, leading to widespread resentment and contributing to economic instability for Arab communities.

#### Arab Nationalism and Resistance

##### Western Wall Riots (1929)

Disputes over access to the Western Wall escalated into violence in Jerusalem and other parts of Palestine. Over 200 people were killed, with the violence highlighting the intensifying struggle for control over religious and cultural sites.

##### Formation of Arab Nationalist Movements

Arab nationalist leaders, including Haj Amin al-Husseini, organized political and grassroots resistance to British policies and Zionist immigration. The Arab Executive, established in the 1920s, sought to coordinate efforts for Palestinian independence.

#### The Arab Revolt and British Policies (1936--1939)

##### Arab Revolt

The Arab Revolt unfolded in three distinct phases:

1.  General Strike (1936): A six-month strike targeted British policies and Jewish immigration.
2.  Rural Uprisings (1937--1938): Armed resistance spread across rural areas, targeting British infrastructure and Jewish settlements.
3.  Suppression (1939): British forces, with assistance from Jewish militias, suppressed the revolt, killing thousands of Palestinians and severely weakening Arab leadership.

##### Peel Commission Report (1937)

The Peel Commission proposed partitioning Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. The plan was accepted by Zionist leaders as a basis for negotiation but rejected outright by Arab leaders, who opposed partition on principle.

##### White Paper of 1939

To address Arab grievances, Britain issued the White Paper, restricting Jewish immigration and land purchases. Zionist leaders viewed this as a betrayal, particularly as Jewish refugees from Europe sought refuge from Nazi persecution.

#### World War II and the Holocaust (1939--1945)

##### Impact of the Holocaust

The Holocaust, during which six million Jews were systematically murdered, intensified international support for a Jewish homeland. Survivors sought refuge in Palestine, but British restrictions on immigration fueled Zionist resistance.

##### Jewish Underground Movements

Jewish underground organizations, such as the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi, launched attacks on British military installations and facilitated illegal immigration (Aliyah Bet), bringing Holocaust survivors to Palestine despite British efforts to block their arrival.

#### UNSCOP and Resolution 181: Partition Plan (1947)

##### Formation of UNSCOP

In February 1947, Britain, overwhelmed by escalating violence and unable to reconcile Arab and Jewish demands, referred the Palestine issue to the United Nations. The UN established the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), composed of representatives from 11 countries, tasked with studying the situation and proposing a solution.

-   UNSCOP conducted extensive investigations, including visits to displaced persons' camps in Europe, where Holocaust survivors expressed their desire to immigrate to Palestine.
-   Public hearings in Palestine revealed deep divisions: Jewish representatives largely supported partition, while Arab leaders rejected any plan that would create a Jewish state.

##### The UNSCOP Report

On August 31, 1947, UNSCOP presented two proposals:

1.  Partition Plan: A majority of committee members recommended the division of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an international city (corpus separatum) under UN administration.
2.  Federal State Plan: A minority of members proposed a federated state with autonomous Jewish and Arab regions.

The majority partition plan was favored by most Jewish leaders but categorically rejected by Arab representatives, who viewed it as a violation of their national and territorial rights.

##### Adoption of Resolution 181

-   On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 181, endorsing the partition plan.
    -   Allocation of Land: The plan allocated 56% of Palestine to the Jewish state and 43% to the Arab state, with 1% designated for Jerusalem.
    -   Demographics and Land Ownership: At the time, Jews comprised approximately one-third of the population but owned only about 7% of the land. This imbalance fueled Arab opposition to the plan.
-   The resolution passed with 33 votes in favor, 13 against, and 10 abstentions. Jewish leaders, led by David Ben-Gurion, accepted the plan, while Arab leaders rejected it outright.

##### Reactions to the Partition Plan

-   Jewish Response: Jewish communities celebrated the UN vote, viewing it as a significant step toward statehood. Preparations for state formation, including the mobilization of Jewish militias, accelerated.
-   Arab Response: Arab leaders and neighboring Arab states denounced the plan, declaring it illegitimate. They vowed to resist its implementation by force if necessary.

#### Civil War in Palestine (1947--1948)

##### Escalation of Violence

Following the adoption of Resolution 181, violence erupted between Jewish and Arab communities, marking the start of the civil war phase of the conflict. The period was characterized by:

-   Clashes in Mixed Cities: Cities like Jerusalem, Haifa, and Jaffa saw intense street battles, with neighborhoods often becoming segregated as communities fled violence.
-   Disruption of Transportation: Arab militias targeted Jewish convoys and transportation routes, attempting to isolate Jewish communities and disrupt supply lines.

##### Jewish Militias and Plan Dalet

-   The Haganah: The primary Jewish paramilitary organization, initially defensive, began taking more offensive actions as the conflict escalated.
-   Irgun and Lehi: These smaller, more radical groups carried out controversial operations, including bombings and attacks on Arab civilians.
-   Plan Dalet (April 1948): The Haganah implemented Plan Dalet, a strategy to secure Jewish-controlled territories and establish defensible borders for the impending state. While the plan was framed as defensive, its implementation led to the depopulation of numerous Arab villages, intensifying accusations of ethnic cleansing.

##### Arab Forces and Leadership Challenges

-   Arab forces consisted of irregular militias and volunteers from neighboring countries, often poorly organized and lacking centralized leadership.
-   Infighting among Arab factions further weakened their ability to coordinate a unified resistance to Jewish advances.

##### Key Incidents of the Civil War

-   Deir Yassin Massacre (April 9, 1948): Irgun and Lehi fighters attacked the Arab village of Deir Yassin, killing over 100 villagers, including women and children. The incident was widely publicized and contributed to a mass exodus of Palestinians fearing similar attacks.
-   The Battle for Haifa (April 1948): Jewish forces captured the city of Haifa, leading to the flight of tens of thousands of Arab residents.
-   Jaffa and Jerusalem: Heavy fighting in these strategically significant cities resulted in high casualties and large-scale displacements.

##### The Palestinian Exodus (1947--1948)

By mid-1948, an estimated 700,000 Palestinians had fled or been expelled from their homes, an event known as the Nakba (*catastrophe*). Factors contributing to the exodus included:

-   -   Fear of violence following incidents like Deir Yassin.
    -   Direct expulsions carried out by Jewish forces in contested areas.
    -   Collateral effects of the ongoing conflict, including destruction of villages and infrastructure.

#### British Withdrawal and the Declaration of Israel (1948)

##### British Withdrawal

-   As violence escalated, Britain announced its intention to terminate the Mandate on May 14, 1948. The British military largely withdrew from the region, avoiding direct involvement in the escalating conflict.
-   The lack of a clear transitional authority created a power vacuum, further exacerbating the violence.

##### Declaration of the State of Israel

-   On May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared the establishment of the State of Israel in Tel Aviv. The declaration referenced the UN partition plan and emphasized Israel's readiness to cooperate with the Arab population and neighboring states.

##### Arab Invasion and the Transition to Regional War

-   The day after Israel's declaration, armies from Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon invaded, marking the start of the First Arab-Israeli War.
-   This regional conflict would reshape the political and demographic landscape of Palestine, solidifying the displacement of Palestinian communities and setting the stage for decades of ongoing conflict.

## Post-1948 Period: Key Developments in the Israel-Palestine Conflict
This section examines the events following the establishment of Israel in 1948, detailing major political, military, and social developments.

#### 1949: Armistice Agreements

##### Establishment of the Green Line

The 1949 Armistice Agreements, brokered by the United Nations, established the "Green Line" as the de facto borders of Israel following the Arab-Israeli War of 1948. These agreements were signed with Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria between January and July 1949. Under these terms, Jordan assumed control of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and formally annexed the territory in 1950, a move recognized only by Britain and Pakistan. Egypt took administrative control of the Gaza Strip but did not annex it, governing it under military authority. These borders remained temporary, with no formal recognition of Israel by its Arab neighbors.

##### Palestinian Refugees and UN Resolution 194

The armistice agreements left approximately 700,000 Palestinian refugees in exile, having fled or been expelled during the 1948 war (*Nakba*, or "catastrophe"). These refugees settled in camps across neighboring Arab countries, the West Bank, and Gaza. The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 194 in December 1948, emphasizing the right of refugees to return to their homes or receive compensation. However, the resolution was rejected by Arab states, and Israel viewed its implementation as a potential threat to its demographic stability. This unresolved issue became a cornerstone of the ongoing conflict.

#### 1950s: Early Conflicts and Regional Alignments

##### The Law of Return and Jewish Immigration

In 1950, Israel enacted the Law of Return, granting all Jews worldwide the right to immigrate to Israel and obtain citizenship. This policy facilitated the immigration of Holocaust survivors and Jews fleeing persecution in Arab countries, significantly increasing Israel's population. Between 1948 and 1951, over 700,000 Jewish immigrants arrived, transforming Israel into a multiethnic Jewish state. While this strengthened Israel's economy and military, it also deepened tensions with its Arab neighbors.

##### Cross-Border Raids and Reprisal Operations

Throughout the 1950s, Palestinian fedayeen, operating from Jordanian and Egyptian-administered territories, launched cross-border raids into Israel, targeting civilians and infrastructure. These attacks prompted Israeli military reprisals, including the 1953 Qibya raid led by Ariel Sharon, in which over 60 Palestinian civilians were killed. These cycles of violence escalated animosities and solidified the Arab-Israeli divide.

##### The Suez Crisis (1956)

The Suez Crisis was triggered by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal, a critical waterway for global trade. In response, Israel, Britain, and France launched a coordinated military operation, with Israel capturing the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. However, under pressure from the United States and the United Nations, all three withdrew, leading to the deployment of the first UN peacekeeping forces in the region. The crisis bolstered Nasser's leadership in the Arab world and intensified Arab opposition to Israel.

#### 1960s: The Six-Day War and Occupation

##### Formation of the PLO

In 1964, the Arab League established the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to represent Palestinian interests and coordinate efforts to reclaim Palestine. The PLO charter called for the elimination of Israel through armed struggle, aligning it with broader Arab nationalist goals. While initially under Arab League control, the PLO became increasingly autonomous, symbolizing Palestinian aspirations for statehood.

##### The Six-Day War (1967)

The Six-Day War in June 1967 dramatically altered the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. Following rising tensions, including the closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, Israel launched a preemptive strike against Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. In just six days, Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, and Golan Heights, tripling its territory. Over 300,000 Palestinians were displaced, many for the second time. The war marked the beginning of Israeli military occupation of these territories and intensified international scrutiny of the conflict.

##### UN Resolution 242

Adopted in the aftermath of the Six-Day War, UN Resolution 242 called for Israel's withdrawal from occupied territories in exchange for recognition of all states' right to live in peace. The resolution became the basis for future peace negotiations, but disagreements over its interpretation---particularly regarding the scope of Israel's withdrawal---prevented its implementation.

#### 1970s: The Yom Kippur War and Peace with Egypt

##### Black September and the Expulsion of the PLO

In September 1970, tensions between the PLO and Jordan erupted into open conflict after the PLO attempted to challenge Jordanian sovereignty. The Jordanian military launched a brutal crackdown, expelling the PLO to Lebanon. This event, known as Black September, significantly weakened Palestinian armed factions and shifted the PLO's base of operations.

##### The Yom Kippur War (1973)

In October 1973, Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israel during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. The war initially caught Israel off guard, allowing Egyptian and Syrian forces to make territorial gains. However, Israel counterattacked, regaining its positions and solidifying its military dominance. The war exposed vulnerabilities in Israeli security and set the stage for U.S.-led peace initiatives.

##### Camp David Accords (1978)

The Camp David Accords, mediated by U.S. President Jimmy Carter, represented a historic breakthrough in Arab-Israeli relations. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin agreed to a peace treaty in which Egypt recognized Israel, and Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula. While the accords secured peace between Egypt and Israel, they alienated Egypt from the broader Arab world and left the Palestinian issue unresolved.

#### 1980s: Lebanon War and the First Intifada

##### Israel's Annexation of the Golan Heights

In 1981, Israel formally annexed the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War. The move was widely condemned by the international community, including the United Nations, which deemed it a violation of international law.

##### The Lebanon War (1982)

Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to expel the PLO following cross-border attacks. The invasion culminated in the Siege of Beirut, during which the PLO was forced to relocate to Tunisia. The war also saw the Sabra and Shatila massacres, carried out by Lebanese Christian militias allied with Israel, resulting in widespread international condemnation.

##### The First Intifada (1987--1993)

The First Intifada erupted in 1987 as a grassroots Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. Marked by widespread protests, boycotts, and clashes, the intifada drew international attention to the plight of Palestinians under occupation. It also led to the rise of Hamas as a political and military rival to the PLO, further complicating the Palestinian national movement.

#### 1990s: Oslo Accords and Limited Autonomy

##### The Madrid Conference (1991)

The Madrid Conference, co-sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union, brought Israel, Arab states, and Palestinians together for direct negotiations. It marked the first formal recognition of the need for dialogue between Israel and the PLO.

##### The Oslo Accords (1993--1995)

The Oslo Accords established the Palestinian Authority (PA) as an interim government to administer parts of the West Bank and Gaza. While hailed as a breakthrough, the accords left critical issues unresolved, including Jerusalem's status, refugees' rights, and final borders. The assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 further derailed the peace process.

#### 2000s: Second Intifada and the Rise of Hamas

##### Collapse of Peace Talks at Camp David (2000)

The Camp David Summit in July 2000, hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton, brought together Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to negotiate a final-status agreement. The talks addressed contentious issues such as the status of Jerusalem, borders, security, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. However, the negotiations collapsed, with both sides blaming each other for the failure. The lack of progress and deep mistrust between the parties fueled frustration among Palestinians, setting the stage for further unrest.

##### The Second Intifada (2000--2005)

In September 2000, Ariel Sharon, then a prominent Israeli political figure, visited the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem, a site sacred to both Jews and Muslims. The visit was perceived by Palestinians as a provocative act and sparked widespread protests and clashes. The unrest escalated into the Second Intifada, characterized by suicide bombings, Israeli military incursions, and significant violence on both sides. Thousands of Palestinians and Israelis were killed or injured during this period, and the conflict severely damaged any remaining trust between the two sides. Israel intensified its military presence in the West Bank and Gaza, while militant groups such as Hamas gained prominence.

##### Construction of the Israeli Security Barrier (2002)

In response to the wave of suicide bombings and security concerns during the Second Intifada, Israel began constructing a security barrier in and around the West Bank. While Israeli officials justified the barrier as necessary for preventing attacks, Palestinians and international critics argued that its route, which often extended deep into Palestinian territory, amounted to de facto annexation. The barrier disrupted daily life for Palestinians, limiting their access to jobs, healthcare, and education.

##### Gaza Disengagement (2005)

In 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon implemented a unilateral disengagement plan, withdrawing all Israeli settlers and military personnel from the Gaza Strip. While Israel retained control of Gaza's borders, airspace, and coastline, the withdrawal marked the first time Israel had dismantled settlements in occupied territory. The move was met with mixed reactions: some viewed it as a step toward peace, while others criticized it as a strategic decision to consolidate Israeli control over the West Bank.

## 2006–2007: Hamas' Electoral Victory and Political Division
This section delves into the events surrounding Hamas' electoral victory in 2006, the subsequent political and territorial division of the Palestinian territories, and the broader ramifications for the Israel-Palestine conflict.

#### Hamas Wins Palestinian Legislative Elections (January 2006)

##### Election Results and Significance

In January 2006, Hamas secured a sweeping victory in the Palestinian Legislative Council elections, winning 74 of the 132 seats and defeating the Fatah party, which won only 45 seats. This marked a significant shift in Palestinian politics, as it was the first time Hamas, primarily known for its armed resistance against Israel, gained political power. The elections were widely regarded as free and fair, monitored by international observers who commended the process despite the challenging political climate.

##### Factors Behind Hamas' Victory

Hamas' electoral success reflected widespread dissatisfaction with the Palestinian Authority (PA) under Fatah, which had been accused of corruption, inefficiency, and failing to deliver tangible improvements in governance or progress in peace negotiations. Hamas' campaign focused on anti-corruption promises, improving social services, and maintaining resistance against Israeli occupation. The group's network of schools, hospitals, and charities further bolstered its popularity among Palestinians.

##### International Reaction

The international community, including Israel, the United States, and the European Union, refused to recognize the Hamas-led government, labeling the organization as a terrorist group. These entities demanded that Hamas renounce violence, recognize Israel, and honor previous agreements. Hamas' refusal to comply led to the suspension of international aid to the Palestinian Authority and the imposition of sanctions, further exacerbating economic challenges in the territories.

#### Formation of the Hamas-Led Government (March 2006)

##### Ismail Haniyeh as Prime Minister

In March 2006, Hamas formed a government, appointing Ismail Haniyeh as Prime Minister. Despite Hamas' electoral mandate, Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority and a Fatah leader, retained significant executive powers. This dual authority structure led to frequent clashes between the Hamas-led cabinet and Abbas over control of security forces, foreign relations, and governance.

##### Early Challenges

The Hamas-led government faced immediate and severe challenges. Israel froze the transfer of tax revenues collected on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, amounting to a significant portion of its budget. Coupled with international sanctions, this led to a fiscal crisis, leaving public sector employees unpaid for months and sparking widespread protests.

#### Tensions Between Hamas and Fatah (Mid-2006)

##### Escalating Violence

Throughout 2006, tensions between Hamas and Fatah escalated into sporadic violence, particularly in Gaza. Armed groups affiliated with both factions clashed over control of security forces, government ministries, and public institutions. Kidnappings, assassinations, and targeted attacks on rival offices became commonplace.

##### Failed Mediation Efforts

Efforts by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar to mediate between Hamas and Fatah achieved temporary ceasefires, but these agreements were frequently violated. The lack of trust between the factions and their competing visions for Palestinian governance made lasting reconciliation elusive.

#### Israeli-Palestinian Tensions: Kidnapping of Gilad Shalit (June 2006)

##### The Kidnapping Incident

On June 25, 2006, Hamas and allied militants launched a cross-border attack from Gaza, killing two Israeli soldiers and capturing a third, Gilad Shalit. The incident triggered a major escalation in violence between Israel and Hamas.

##### Israeli Retaliation: Operation Summer Rains

In response, Israel launched Operation Summer Rains, involving airstrikes on Gaza's infrastructure and ground incursions. The military campaign resulted in the deaths of over 400 Palestinians, including civilians, and caused significant destruction to Gaza's infrastructure. The operation heightened tensions and further isolated Gaza internationally.

#### The Slide into Civil War (Late 2006--Early 2007)

##### Economic Collapse and Protests (January--February 2007)

By late 2006, international sanctions, Israel's blockade, and internal governance challenges had plunged the Palestinian territories into economic crisis. Public sector employees went unpaid for extended periods, leading to widespread protests and strikes. The dire economic conditions fueled animosity between Hamas and Fatah supporters.

##### Clashes Between Armed Factions -- Street Battles in Gaza (March--May 2007)

Violent clashes intensified between Hamas' military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and Fatah-aligned security forces. Both factions accused each other of undermining the Palestinian cause and attempting to stage coups.

#### Hamas' Takeover of Gaza (June 2007)

##### The Outbreak of Fighting

In June 2007, the power struggle between Hamas and Fatah erupted into full-scale fighting in Gaza. Hamas launched a coordinated offensive, targeting Fatah-controlled security installations and government buildings. The fighting resulted in dozens of casualties and widespread destruction.

##### Hamas Establishes Control Over Gaza and the Division of Palestinian Territories

After several days of intense battles, Hamas seized full control of Gaza, forcing Fatah officials to flee to the West Bank or seek refuge in Israel and Egypt. The takeover marked the effective division of the Palestinian territories into two separate political entities:

-   Gaza Strip: Governed by Hamas, which implemented its own administrative and security policies.
-   West Bank: Controlled by the Palestinian Authority, dominated by Fatah under Mahmoud Abbas.

* * * * *

#### Consequences of the Political Division

##### Economic Isolation and Humanitarian Crisis

The Hamas takeover prompted Israel and Egypt to impose a stricter blockade on Gaza, citing security concerns. The blockade, combined with Hamas' inability to access international aid, led to severe economic and humanitarian crises. Unemployment soared (over 50%), and shortages of food, medicine, and building materials became chronic.

##### Polarization of Palestinian Politics

The division entrenched political polarization among Palestinians, with Hamas and Fatah each claiming legitimacy while accusing the other of betraying the Palestinian cause. This split weakened Palestinian efforts to negotiate with Israel and undermined prospects for a two-state solution.

##### International Reactions

The international community continued to recognize the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Efforts by regional powers, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to mediate between Hamas and Fatah repeatedly failed, leaving the Palestinian territories politically fragmented.

## 2007–2009: Gaza Blockade and Operation Cast Lead
This section provides a detailed examination of the Gaza Blockade (2007) and the 2008--2009 Gaza War (Operation Cast Lead), emphasizing the key events, their consequences, and the broader implications for the region.

#### The Gaza Blockade (2007)

##### Hamas' Takeover and the Initiation of the Blockade

In June 2007, after a violent conflict with Fatah, Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip. This development led to the political division of the Palestinian territories, with Hamas governing Gaza and the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority administering the West Bank.

In response to Hamas' takeover, Israel and Egypt imposed a land, sea, and air blockade on Gaza. The blockade aimed to restrict the movement of goods and people into and out of the territory, citing concerns over the smuggling of weapons and the manufacturing of rockets used by militants to attack Israel. Israel further justified the blockade as necessary to isolate Hamas, which it considers a terrorist organization.

##### Economic Impact

The blockade caused a near-total collapse of Gaza's formal economy, severely limiting exports and restricting imports of essential goods. Agriculture, manufacturing, and fishing industries were devastated, leading to widespread unemployment. By 2008, Gaza's unemployment rate exceeded 40%, with poverty rates soaring. Smuggling tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border emerged as a critical lifeline for the territory, bringing in goods ranging from food and medicine to weapons and fuel.

##### Humanitarian Consequences

The blockade led to severe shortages of essential supplies, including clean water, electricity, and medical equipment. Humanitarian organizations repeatedly warned of a worsening crisis, with Gaza's population---largely dependent on international aid---facing dire conditions. The United Nations and rights groups criticized the blockade as a form of collective punishment, a violation of international law.

#### 2008: Escalation of Violence Leading to War

##### Rocket Fire from Gaza

Throughout 2008, militant groups in Gaza, including Hamas, launched an increasing number of rockets and mortars into southern Israel. These attacks targeted civilian areas such as Sderot, Ashkelon, and smaller communities, disrupting daily life and causing injuries and fatalities. The frequency and intensity of these attacks heightened tensions, with Israeli communities living under constant fear.

##### Israeli Airstrikes and Targeted Killings

Israel responded with airstrikes targeting Hamas' military infrastructure, including rocket launch sites, weapons depots, and smuggling tunnels. Several senior Hamas figures were assassinated during this period. However, these actions often resulted in collateral damage, including civilian casualties, further exacerbating the situation.

##### Ceasefire Agreement (June 2008)

In June 2008, a six-month ceasefire was brokered by Egypt between Hamas and Israel. The agreement temporarily reduced violence, with both sides claiming partial success:

-   Hamas: Sought a significant easing of the blockade as part of the deal.
-   Israel: Aimed to halt rocket fire and maintain security for its southern communities.\
    The truce remained fragile, as neither side fully trusted the other's commitment to the terms.

##### Collapse of the Ceasefire (November 2008)

On November 4, 2008, Israeli forces conducted a raid into Gaza to destroy a tunnel they claimed was being prepared for an attack. This action killed several Hamas militants, leading Hamas to resume rocket fire. Israel responded with intensified airstrikes, and the situation rapidly deteriorated into open conflict.

#### 2008--2009 Gaza War (Operation Cast Lead)

##### Initial Air Campaign (December 27, 2008)

On December 27, 2008, Israel launched Operation Cast Lead, beginning with a massive air campaign targeting Hamas' military infrastructure. The strikes hit police stations, government buildings, rocket launch sites, and tunnels used for smuggling. Over 200 Palestinians were killed on the first day, making it one of the deadliest days in Gaza's history. While Israel emphasized the precision of its strikes, many civilians were among the casualties.

##### Ground Invasion (January 3, 2009)

After a week of aerial bombardment, Israel initiated a ground invasion of Gaza. Thousands of Israeli troops entered densely populated urban areas, encountering resistance from Hamas fighters employing guerrilla tactics, including the use of booby traps, tunnels, and ambushes.

-   Civilian Impact: Urban warfare led to widespread destruction of homes, schools, hospitals, and mosques.
-   Infrastructure Damage: Key facilities, including Gaza's only power plant and water networks, were severely damaged, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.

##### Casualties and Humanitarian Crisis

-   Palestinian Death Toll: Over 1,400 Palestinians were killed, including an estimated 400 children, according to UN reports.
-   Israeli Death Toll: 13 Israelis were killed, including 10 soldiers and three civilians.
-   Displacement: Thousands of Gazans were displaced as homes were destroyed, forcing many into overcrowded shelters. The lack of medical supplies and access to care overwhelmed Gaza's already strained health system.

##### International Reaction

-   Criticism of Israel: The United Nations and human rights organizations accused Israel of using disproportionate force and failing to protect civilians. The destruction of civilian infrastructure and high death toll drew widespread condemnation.
-   Criticism of Hamas: Hamas was criticized for firing rockets indiscriminately at Israeli civilian areas and for operating within densely populated neighborhoods, effectively using civilians as human shields.

#### Aftermath of the Gaza War

##### Ceasefire and Withdrawal (January 18, 2009)

On January 18, 2009, Israel declared a unilateral ceasefire, followed by a similar announcement from Hamas. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza but maintained the blockade. Sporadic violence continued in the months that followed, with occasional rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes.

##### Rebuilding Amid the Blockade

Efforts to rebuild Gaza were severely hindered by the blockade, which restricted the import of construction materials and other essential goods. Many homes, schools, and hospitals remained in ruins, with international aid organizations struggling to address the scale of the damage.

##### Goldstone Report (2009)

The United Nations commissioned an investigation into the conflict, led by South African judge Richard Goldstone.

-   Findings: The Goldstone Report accused both Israel and Hamas of actions that could constitute war crimes, including attacks on civilians and violations of international law.
-   Controversy: The report faced criticism from both sides, with Israel rejecting its findings as biased and Hamas disputing accusations of using civilians as shields.

##### Political Ramifications

-   The conflict deepened the divide between Hamas and Fatah, further complicating efforts for Palestinian political reconciliation.
-   Israel's relations with the international community, particularly in Europe and the Arab world, became more strained due to the war's humanitarian toll.

## 2009–2012: Events Between the Goldstone Report and Operation Pillar of Defense
This section explores the major events between the release of the Goldstone Report in 2009 and the beginning of the 2012 Gaza conflict (Operation Pillar of Defense), highlighting significant developments in the Israel-Palestine conflict during this period.

#### Aftermath of the Goldstone Report (2009)

##### Release and Impact of the Report

In September 2009, the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission, led by Justice Richard Goldstone, published its findings on the 2008--2009 Gaza War. The report accused both Israel and Hamas of committing potential war crimes, with Israel criticized for disproportionate use of force and Hamas for indiscriminately targeting Israeli civilians.

-   Israel's Reaction: Israel dismissed the report as biased and emphasized its right to defend its citizens against rocket fire. It conducted internal investigations but argued that the report ignored the complexities of asymmetric warfare.
-   Hamas' Reaction: Hamas welcomed the report's condemnation of Israel but denied allegations that it used human shields or violated international law.

##### Broader International Reactions

The Goldstone Report intensified global debates about the legality and morality of actions during the Gaza War. While it increased scrutiny of Israel's policies in Gaza, it also highlighted the challenges of addressing violations in protracted conflicts.

#### The Gaza Freedom Flotilla Incident (May 2010)

##### The Flotilla and Israeli Raid

In May 2010, the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, a convoy of six ships led by the Turkish vessel Mavi Marmara, attempted to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Israeli naval forces intercepted the flotilla in international waters, boarding the vessels. A violent confrontation ensued aboard the Mavi Marmara, resulting in the deaths of nine Turkish activists and injuries to dozens of others.

-   Israeli Perspective: Israel argued that the flotilla aimed to provoke a confrontation and that its forces acted in self-defense after being attacked with knives and metal rods.
-   International Outcry: The incident sparked widespread condemnation, with critics arguing that Israel used excessive force. The United Nations launched an inquiry, which criticized Israel's actions but also affirmed the legality of the blockade under international law.

##### Diplomatic Fallout

-   Relations between Israel and Turkey, once strong, deteriorated significantly. Turkey expelled the Israeli ambassador, downgraded diplomatic ties, and demanded an official apology and compensation for the victims.
-   The incident galvanized international calls to end the blockade, although Israel maintained its security rationale.

#### Easing of the Gaza Blockade (June 2010)

##### Policy Shift by Israel

In response to international pressure following the flotilla incident, Israel announced measures to ease the blockade. It allowed more consumer goods into Gaza while maintaining restrictions on items deemed dual-use, such as construction materials and fuel, which Israel argued could be used for military purposes.

-   Impact on Gaza's Economy: The easing had limited effects, as key industries reliant on exports and construction materials remained crippled. Gaza's unemployment and poverty rates remained among the highest in the world.

##### Humanitarian Criticism

While the easing allowed for an increase in humanitarian aid, rights groups argued that the blockade continued to constitute collective punishment under international law. The restrictions perpetuated Gaza's dependence on international aid, limiting its economic recovery.

#### Palestinian Bid for UN Membership (2011)

##### Application for Full UN Membership

In September 2011, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas submitted an application for Palestine to become a full member state of the United Nations. Abbas argued that international recognition of Palestinian statehood was essential for achieving peace.

-   UN Security Council Response: The bid faced strong opposition from the United States, which threatened to veto the proposal, and failed to secure the necessary support within the Security Council.

##### Symbolic Importance

Despite the setback, the move highlighted growing international sympathy for the Palestinian cause and frustration with the stalled peace process. The bid reinforced Palestinian efforts to gain recognition through multilateral institutions.

#### Arab Spring and Regional Shifts (2011)

##### Impact of the Arab Spring

The wave of uprisings across the Arab world significantly reshaped regional dynamics:

-   Egypt: The ousting of President Hosni Mubarak, a key mediator in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, created uncertainty about Egypt's future role. While Egypt's military maintained the peace treaty with Israel, popular sentiment became increasingly critical of Israel.
-   Syria: Hamas' ties with Syria were strained as the Syrian Civil War erupted. Hamas distanced itself from the Assad regime, aligning more closely with Qatar and Turkey.

##### Hamas' Changing Alliances

Hamas' realignment weakened its traditional support base in Syria and Iran but strengthened its ties with Sunni powers such as Turkey and Qatar. These shifting alliances influenced the group's strategies and regional relationships.

#### Renewed Violence and Tensions (2012)

##### Rocket Fire and Israeli Airstrikes

Throughout 2012, violence along the Gaza-Israel border escalated. Militant groups in Gaza fired rockets into Israeli cities, prompting Israeli airstrikes targeting Hamas and other factions.

-   Iron Dome Deployment: Israel deployed its Iron Dome missile defense system to intercept rockets, significantly reducing casualties and damage in southern cities.

##### Hunger Strikes by Palestinian Prisoners

Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails launched hunger strikes to protest administrative detention (imprisonment without trial) and poor prison conditions.

-   International Attention: The hunger strikes drew significant international attention and placed pressure on Israel to address prisoner rights, highlighting the broader issue of human rights in the occupied territories.

##### Settlement Expansion

Israel continued to expand settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, despite international condemnation. These actions further complicated efforts to restart peace negotiations and fueled Palestinian grievances about the erosion of their territorial claims.

##### Egypt's Changing Role

-   After the July 2013 coup in Egypt that ousted President Mohamed Morsi, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's government adopted a hardline stance toward Hamas, accusing it of supporting militants in the Sinai Peninsula.
-   Egypt intensified its crackdown on Gaza's smuggling tunnels, destroying hundreds of them, which further isolated Gaza and exacerbated its economic crisis.

#### 2014: Rising Tensions Leading to the Gaza War

##### Hamas-Fatah Reconciliation Agreement (April 2014)

-   In April 2014, Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation agreement to form a unity government, aiming to end the political division between Gaza and the West Bank.
-   Israeli Reaction: Israel opposed the agreement, arguing that it undermined peace efforts, as Hamas continued to reject Israel's right to exist.

-   On June 12, 2014, three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed in the West Bank.
-   Operation Brother's Keeper: Israel launched a large-scale military operation, arresting hundreds of Hamas members in the West Bank and conducting raids on Palestinian homes.
-   Hamas' Denial: While Israel accused Hamas of orchestrating the abductions, Hamas denied involvement, though the incident heightened tensions significantly.

##### Retaliatory Violence: Murder of Mohammed Abu Khdeir (July 2014)

-   In July 2014, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, a 16-year-old Palestinian, was kidnapped and murdered by Jewish extremists in East Jerusalem, reportedly in retaliation for the killing of the Israeli teenagers.
-   The murder sparked widespread protests and clashes across Jerusalem and the West Bank, further escalating tensions.

#### 2014 Gaza War: Operation Protective Edge (July 8--August 26, 2014)

##### Outbreak of War (July 8, 2014)

## Post-2014 Gaza War to Pre-Trump Era (2017)
This section provides an in-depth exploration of significant events between the conclusion of the 2014 Gaza War and the beginning of Donald Trump's presidency in January 2017, emphasizing key political, military, and humanitarian developments during this period.

#### 2014: Aftermath of Operation Protective Edge

##### Reconstruction Challenges in Gaza

The 2014 Gaza War left over 20,000 homes destroyed or severely damaged, with Gaza's infrastructure in ruins. The Israeli blockade and political disputes between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority delayed reconstruction efforts.

-   Donor Conference (October 2014): An international donor conference held in Cairo pledged $5.4 billion for reconstruction. However, only a fraction of the funds were disbursed due to concerns over Hamas' governance and the lack of coordination between Palestinian factions.
-   Living Conditions: Electricity shortages, inadequate access to clean water, and widespread unemployment created a deepening humanitarian crisis, with over 80% of Gaza's population relying on international aid.

##### Escalation of Tensions in Jerusalem

In late 2014, clashes erupted at the Al-Aqsa Mosque/Temple Mount compound over perceived attempts by Israeli authorities to alter the status quo at the site.

-   Palestinian Protests: Palestinians accused Israel of restricting Muslim worshippers and allowing increased access to Jewish visitors.
-   Israeli Response: Israeli authorities cited security concerns, implementing measures that Palestinians viewed as provocative.\
    The violence extended to other parts of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, heightening tensions between communities.

#### 2015: ICC Membership and Rise of Violence

##### Palestine Joins the International Criminal Court (ICC)

In April 2015, Palestine formally joined the ICC, enabling it to file cases against Israel for alleged war crimes committed during the 2014 Gaza War.

-   ICC Preliminary Investigations: The ICC began examining alleged violations of international law in Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.
-   Israeli Reaction: Israel criticized the move as a unilateral action that undermined peace efforts. Israeli officials argued that the ICC was biased and overstepping its mandate.

##### Stabbing Intifada (Late 2015)

A surge of violence erupted in late 2015, characterized by a series of lone-wolf attacks by Palestinians against Israeli civilians and security personnel.

-   Nature of Attacks: The violence, often referred to as the "Stabbing Intifada," included stabbings, shootings, and vehicular rammings.
-   Casualties: Over 250 Palestinians and 30 Israelis were killed between late 2015 and 2016.
-   Israeli Response: Israeli forces increased security measures, including the deployment of troops and the use of live fire during clashes. Critics accused Israel of excessive force, while Israel argued its actions were necessary for self-defense.

#### 2016: International Diplomacy and Settlements

##### Paris Peace Initiative

In June 2016, France convened an international conference to revive peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.

-   Objectives: The initiative aimed to establish a framework for a two-state solution, focusing on resolving core issues such as borders, settlements, and the status of Jerusalem.
-   Outcome: Israel rejected the initiative, arguing that direct negotiations were the only viable path to peace. Palestinian leaders supported the effort but expressed skepticism about its potential impact.

##### UN Security Council Resolution 2334

In December 2016, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2334, declaring Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem a violation of international law.

-   U.S. Abstention: The resolution passed after the U.S. abstained rather than using its veto power, a significant departure from previous U.S. policy.
-   Reactions:
    -   Israel: Strongly condemned the resolution, accusing the UN of bias and asserting its right to build in "disputed territories."
    -   Palestinians: Welcomed the resolution as a reaffirmation of international opposition to settlement expansion.

#### Humanitarian Challenges in Gaza

##### Electricity Crisis (2015--2016)

Gaza experienced severe electricity shortages, with residents receiving only 4--6 hours of power per day.

-   Causes: The crisis stemmed from disputes between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority over payments for fuel, coupled with damage to Gaza's power infrastructure during the 2014 war.
-   Humanitarian Impact: Hospitals, water treatment facilities, and sanitation systems were severely affected, exacerbating public health challenges.

##### Egypt's Role in Gaza

Egypt, under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, maintained a strict policy toward Hamas, accusing the group of supporting militants in the Sinai Peninsula.

-   Rafah Crossing: Egypt frequently closed the Rafah border crossing, Gaza's primary gateway to the outside world.
-   Smuggling Tunnels: Egyptian forces destroyed hundreds of smuggling tunnels along the Gaza-Sinai border, cutting off a vital supply route for goods and weapons.

#### Regional Implications and Political Shifts

##### Impact of the Syrian Civil War

The Syrian Civil War altered regional alliances, affecting Hamas' relationships with key actors:

-   Distance from Assad: Hamas distanced itself from the Assad regime in Syria, weakening its ties with Iran.
-   New Allies: Qatar and Turkey emerged as key supporters of Hamas, providing financial and political backing.

##### Palestinian Political Divisions

The divide between Hamas in Gaza and the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank deepened during this period:

-   Efforts to form a unity government repeatedly failed due to mutual distrust and conflicting priorities.
-   The division continued to undermine Palestinian political unity, complicating international diplomatic efforts.

## Shifting Policies and Persistent Conflict (2017–2019)
This section delves deeply into the events of 2017--2019, a period of critical significance in the Israel-Palestine conflict. These years were marked by significant policy shifts, political upheavals, and recurring violence, with lasting implications for the region.

#### 2017: Shifting U.S. Policies and Rising Regional Tensions

##### Donald Trump Assumes Office (January 2017)

Donald Trump's inauguration as the 45th President of the United States marked a major departure in U.S. policy regarding Israel and Palestine.

-   Pro-Israel Orientation: Trump expressed unequivocal support for Israel, fostering a closer relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Unlike his predecessors, Trump openly questioned the viability of a two-state solution, signaling potential U.S. backing for alternative frameworks.
-   Embassy Relocation Promise: During his campaign, Trump pledged to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. While prior administrations had avoided this due to its sensitivity, Trump's administration viewed it as a reaffirmation of U.S. support for Israel. This announcement sparked significant concern among Palestinians, who viewed it as a deliberate dismissal of their claims to East Jerusalem.

##### Hamas' New Political Charter (May 2017)

In a strategic move, Hamas unveiled a revised political charter in May 2017, reflecting subtle shifts in its stance on key issues.

-   Acceptance of 1967 Borders: The charter indicated Hamas' willingness to accept a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, though it continued to reject Israel's legitimacy.
-   Distancing from Muslim Brotherhood: By distancing itself from the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas sought to improve its strained relations with Egypt and other regional powers.
-   Israel's Reaction: Israeli officials dismissed the new charter as a public relations stunt, pointing to Hamas' continued support for armed resistance and rocket attacks against Israel.

##### Temple Mount/Al-Aqsa Clashes (July 2017)

The summer of 2017 saw heightened tensions at the Temple Mount/Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a site sacred to both Muslims and Jews.

-   Metal Detectors Installed: After an attack that killed two Israeli police officers, Israel introduced new security measures, including metal detectors at the entrances to the compound.
-   Palestinian Response: Palestinians perceived the measures as an encroachment on their religious freedoms, sparking widespread protests and violent clashes across East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
-   Israeli Reversal: Amid mounting international pressure, Israel removed the metal detectors, but tensions over the site remained unresolved, with sporadic clashes continuing throughout the year.

##### U.S. Recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's Capital (December 2017)

In a landmark decision, Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced plans to relocate the U.S. embassy there.

-   International Backlash: The announcement was met with widespread condemnation, with the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly passing a resolution denouncing the decision. Protests erupted across the Arab world, and Palestinian leaders accused the U.S. of abandoning its role as an impartial mediator.
-   Implications: This move effectively sidelined the U.S. in peace negotiations and emboldened Israeli settlement activity in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.

#### 2018: Escalating Violence and Controversial Legislation

##### The Great March of Return (March--December 2018)

In March 2018, Palestinians in Gaza launched the Great March of Return, a series of weekly protests along the border with Israel.

-   Demands: Protesters called for the right of return for Palestinian refugees and an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza.
-   Israeli Response:
    -   Israeli forces deployed snipers, tear gas, and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, arguing that Hamas was using the protests as a cover for attacks on the border.
    -   Critics accused Israel of using excessive force, with human rights organizations condemning the high civilian death toll.
-   Casualties:
    -   Over 200 Palestinians were killed during the protests, including children, journalists, and medics. Thousands were injured, many with life-altering disabilities.
    -   One Israeli soldier was killed during the protests.

##### U.S. Embassy Relocation to Jerusalem (May 2018)

On May 14, 2018, the U.S. officially relocated its embassy to Jerusalem, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of Israel's founding.

-   Palestinian Protests: The event triggered mass demonstrations along the Gaza border, culminating in one of the deadliest days of the Great March of Return. Over 60 Palestinians were killed, and hundreds were injured by Israeli live fire.
-   Diplomatic Repercussions: The relocation further alienated the U.S. from international consensus on Jerusalem's status and deepened Palestinian distrust of American mediation.

##### Passage of the Nation-State Law (July 2018)

The Israeli Knesset passed the Nation-State Law, formally defining Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.

-   Key Provisions:
    -   Hebrew was established as the sole official language, with Arabic given "special status."
    -   The law emphasized that national self-determination was unique to Jewish citizens.
-   Reactions:
    -   Palestinians: The law was denounced as discriminatory, with critics arguing that it marginalized Israel's Arab minority and undermined the principle of equality.
    -   Israeli Supporters: Proponents defended the law as a reaffirmation of Israel's Jewish identity and historical legacy.

#### 2019: Continued Violence, Political Deadlock, and ICC Investigations

##### Rocket Attacks and Retaliatory Strikes

Sporadic rocket fire from Gaza and Israeli airstrikes continued throughout 2019, underscoring the fragility of ceasefire agreements.

-   Escalation in March: A long-range rocket from Gaza struck a home in central Israel, injuring civilians. Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad facilities.
-   Cycle of Violence: These incidents often triggered brief escalations, with both sides exchanging fire before returning to uneasy truces brokered by Egypt and the United Nations.

##### Israeli Elections and Political Deadlock

Israel held two parliamentary elections in 2019 due to political stalemates:

-   April Election: Netanyahu's Likud party narrowly won but failed to form a coalition, leading to another election in September.
-   September Election: The second election also produced no clear majority, leaving Israeli politics in a state of paralysis.
-   Impact: The deadlock delayed major policy decisions and underscored divisions within Israeli society over issues like settlement expansion, religious influence, and Netanyahu's leadership.

##### U.S. Recognition of Israeli Sovereignty Over the Golan Heights (March 2019)

Trump signed a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a strategic territory captured from Syria in 1967.

-   International Reaction: The move was widely condemned, with most countries maintaining that the Golan Heights remains Syrian territory under international law. Critics argued that the decision set a dangerous precedent for territorial disputes worldwide.

##### ICC Investigation Announcement (December 2019)

The International Criminal Court (ICC) announced its intent to investigate alleged war crimes in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem.

-   Palestinian Reaction: Palestinian leaders welcomed the investigation as a step toward accountability.
-   Israeli Response: Israel rejected the investigation, arguing that the ICC lacked jurisdiction and accusing it of political bias.

    -   In the West Bank, Palestinian authorities imposed lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus, further damaging the fragile economy.
-   Limited Cooperation: While Israeli and Palestinian health authorities coordinated on vaccine distribution and medical supplies, political tensions limited broader cooperation.
-   Economic Impact: The blockade in Gaza and pandemic-related restrictions led to widespread unemployment and food insecurity, with over 80% of Gaza's population relying on international aid.

##### The Abraham Accords (August--December 2020)

The Abraham Accords, brokered by the United States, marked a historic normalization of relations between Israel and several Arab nations, including the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan.

-   Regional Realignment:
    -   These agreements reflected a shift in regional priorities, emphasizing economic cooperation and countering Iranian influence over longstanding support for the Palestinian cause.
    -   Palestinians criticized the accords as a betrayal, arguing they undermined the Arab Peace Initiative, which tied normalization to the creation of a Palestinian state.
-   Economic Opportunities: The accords facilitated trade, investment, and tourism between Israel and its new partners, reshaping regional geopolitics.

##### Halted Annexation Plans in the West Bank

In exchange for normalization with the UAE, Israel agreed to suspend plans to annex large parts of the West Bank.

-   International Response: While the suspension was welcomed internationally, Palestinians viewed it as a temporary concession rather than a meaningful step toward peace.
-   Settlement Activity: Despite the halted annexation, Israel continued to expand settlements in the West Bank, drawing international condemnation.

#### 2021: Sheikh Jarrah Evictions and Gaza Conflict

##### Sheikh Jarrah Evictions and East Jerusalem Clashes (May 2021)

The planned evictions of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem, triggered widespread protests and international attention.

-   Legal and Historical Context:
    -   The evictions stemmed from a long-standing legal battle over property claims by Jewish organizations based on pre-1948 ownership.
    -   Palestinians argued that the evictions were part of a broader effort to Judaize East Jerusalem and displace its Arab population.
-   Al-Aqsa Mosque Clashes: Protests escalated into violent confrontations at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound during Ramadan. Israeli police used stun grenades and rubber bullets, injuring hundreds of worshippers, while Palestinians threw stones at security forces.

-   Public Backlash: Protesters argued the reforms threatened Israeli democracy by weakening the judiciary's independence.

-   Humanitarian Concerns:
    -   The displacement of over 1.5 million residents exacerbated the crisis, as makeshift shelters in Gaza proved insufficient to house the displaced.
    -   Aid organizations described the situation as "unprecedented," citing shortages of food, clean water, and medical supplies.
-   International Response: Global protests intensified, demanding an end to the violence and urging international leaders to intervene. Meanwhile, Israel defended its actions as necessary for national security and emphasized Hamas's role in civilian casualties.

#### November 10, 2023: ICC Announces Investigation Into Potential War Crimes

The International Criminal Court (ICC) formally announced an investigation into allegations of war crimes committed by both Hamas and Israel during the ongoing conflict.

-   Scope of Investigation:

    -   It also sought to investigate allegations of disproportionate use of force by Israel in Gaza, particularly airstrikes on densely populated areas.
